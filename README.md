## Self-Reflection:
<!-- Write your self-reflection under this line -->
This program caused me a bit of trouble wrapping my head around JSON objects. I assumed that they would be an object that we would instantiate up front and edit as needed, but instead they ended up being a very fluid thing that was being edited on the fly by our code without a local object. It took me until the end to understand that the JSON object existed externally. It was an interesting puzzle to solve, and I think that I have a good grasp on the concept now.
### How long it took me to finish this?
About 4 hours
I had a bit of personal life issues yesterday that hindered my ability to reason through the assignment. Much of the rest of the time was taken by issues with the testing scripts.

## Discussion Questions:
1. What does the bootstrap `display-4` class do?
{font-size:3.5rem;font-weight:300;line-height:1.2}
display-4 in the bootstraps CSS document, sets the font size, the font weight, and line height of the tag that it is assigned to.
